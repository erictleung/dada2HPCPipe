Description: 16S rRNA microbiome data analysis workflow using DADA2 and R on a
    high performance cluster using Slurm. The functions here are wrappers
    around the DADA2 functions in order to more efficiently use on a cluster.
    The functions break down the workflow into parts based on stopping points
    that require a user's input for the next steps.
